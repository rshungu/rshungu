## ✨ Turning inspiration into code 💻, and code into change 🌍!

🌍 Hello! I'm Rehema Shungu!

A passionate beginner in Data Analytics 📊 with a growing interest in applying data to solve real-world challenges, especially in healthcare 🏥. 

At this stage in my journey, I’ve gained hands-on experience with R, Python, and Linux 🐧 through academic projects and some early professional work at the Department of Hematology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences. While I’m still developing my skills, I’m excited about the potential of machine learning 🤖 and data science 🌱 to create positive impacts. 

I’m exploring how to harness data to uncover patterns, create visualizations 📊, and contribute to healthcare research, all while continuously learning and experimenting. Each project helps me grow and pushes me further in my data journey!
